# Context
We are a multi-culture (America and Bulgarian) family with two children in school taking languages to add to the 2 to 3 languages present in the home. As "the onsite American" at home, I'm a bit (somewhat but not completely) language-bound. Further, my children are skill building for their future including languages.

# Need
I need an application which takes (currently) English and translates to:
1. Bulgarian
1. Russian
1. Spanish
1. Italian

# Stretc
Late I may make the source language (IE English) an definable optional.
